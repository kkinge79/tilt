## Next Steps


- [ ] Have usernames display with corresponding reviews/posts
- [ ] Incorporate Steam API to add the ability to be directed to purchase a title
- [ ] Display significantly more games, and potentially look into pagination
- [ ] Search bar in nav
- [ ] I want to be able to follow other users to see their reviews, posts and collected games.
